# DBGU\_WriteCallbackRegister Function

**Parent topic:**[Debug Unit \(DBGU\)](GUID-97C41240-2AC0-4D05-A97E-83EB780C57A2.md)

## C

```c

/* Non-blocking mode */

void DBGU_WriteCallbackRegister( DBGU_CALLBACK callback, uintptr_t context )

/* Ring buffer mode */

void DBGU_WriteCallbackRegister( DBGU_RING_BUFFER_CALLBACK callback, uintptr_t context)
```

## Summary

Sets the pointer to the function \(and it's context\) to be called when the given DBGU's write events occur.

## Description

This function sets the pointer to a client function to be called "back" when the given DBGU's write events occur. It also passes a context value \(usually a pointer to a context structure\) that is passed into the function when it is called.

## Precondition

DBGU\_Initialize must have been called for the associated DBGU instance.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|callback|Pointer to the function to be called when the write transfer has completed. Setting this to NULL will disable the callback feature.|
|context|A value \(usually a pointer\) passed \(unused\) into the function identified by the callback parameter.|

## Returns

None.

## Example

*Non-blocking mode*

```c

void DBGUWriteEventHandler ( uintptr_t context )
{
    if(DBGU_ErrorGet() != DBGU_ERROR_NONE)
    {
        //Handle error case
    }
    else
    {
        //Transfer completed successfully
    }
}

DBGU_WriteCallbackRegister(DBGUWriteEventHandler, (uintptr_t)NULL);
```

*Ring buffer mode*

```c

bool txThresholdEventReceived = false;

void DBGUWriteEventHandler(DBGU_EVENT event, uintptr_t context )
{
    if (event == DBGU_EVENT_WRITE_THRESHOLD_REACHED)
    {
        txThresholdEventReceived = true;
    }
}

DBGU_WriteCallbackRegister(DBGUWriteEventHandler, (uintptr_t)NULL);
```

## Remarks

None
