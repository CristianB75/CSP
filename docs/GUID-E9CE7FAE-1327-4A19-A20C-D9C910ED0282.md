# Reset Controller \(RCON\)

The Resets collects the various reset sources and generates reset for<br />the device and allows the reset source to be identified by the<br />software. Some of the resets the device support are:

-   **Power On Reset:**The device contains a power-on-reset<br />\(POR\) detector, which keeps the system reset until power is stable.<br />This eliminates the need for external reset circuitry to guarantee<br />stable operation when powering up the device.

-   **Brown Out Reset:**If the voltage supplied to the regulator is<br />inadequate to maintain a regulated level, the regulator Reset circuitry<br />will generate a BOR event, which is synchronized with the system clock,<br />SYSCLK, before asserting the system Reset..

-   **Watchdog Reset:** The watchdog reset occurs when it times out

-   **External Reset/MCLR:**A external reset is generated when a<br />low level is detected on the RESET pin

-   **Software Reset:**Caused by performing software reset command<br />sequence

-   **Configuration Mismatch:** Caused due to configuration bit<br />values are not opposite to each other.

-   **High Voltage Detect:** Caused when high voltage is detected.


Resets are divided into two modes based upon the source of the reset.

-   Power Resets include resets generated by POR, BOR, MCLR.

-   User Resets consist of the external reset, WDT, and the software<br />reset instruction


**Using The Library**

The resets \(RCON\) peripheral library provides API to find the cause of<br />last device reset

**Library Interface**

peripheral library provides the following interfaces:
