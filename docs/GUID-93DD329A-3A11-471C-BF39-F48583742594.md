# AHB Bus Matrix \(MATRIX\)

In order to reduce power consumption without loss in performance, the system embeds three matrixes: one based on the AXI protocol \(AXIMX\) and two based on the AHB protocol \(H64MX and H32MX\).

This section describes the implementation of the 64-bit AHB Matrix \(H64MX\) and the 32-bit AHB Matrix \(H32MX\). Each AHB Matrix implements a multilayer AHB, based on the AHB-Lite protocol, which enables parallel access paths between multiple AHB masters and slaves in a system, thus<br />increasing the overall bandwidth.

The normal latency to connect a master to a slave is one cycle, except for the default master of the accessed slave which is connected directly \(zero cycle latency\).

**Using The Library**

Matrix initializes AHB Masters and Slaves by invoking Matrix\_Initialize\(\) function in the system initialization.

**Library Interface**

AHB Bus Matrix peripheral library provides the following interfaces:

**Functions**
