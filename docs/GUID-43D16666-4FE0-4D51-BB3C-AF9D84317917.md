# USARTx\_ReceiverIsReady Function

**Parent topic:**[Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver Transceiver \(USART\)](GUID-5ED4F08A-8227-486D-9727-78BD47CA0866.md)

## C

```c
/* x = USART instance number */

/* Blocking mode */
bool USARTx_ReceiverIsReady( void )
```

## Summary

Returns the hardware status of the USART Receiver.

## Description

This function returns the hardware status associated with the Receive hardware FIFO of the given USART peripheral instance. When Receiver is ready, user can read the available data. This function is available only in blocking \(non-interrupt\) mode of operation. It can be used to achieve non-blocking behavior of USARTx\_Read function even if the library is configured for blocking behavior. If this function returns true, calling the USARTx\_Read function with a byte count of 1 will result in non-blocking behavior.

## Precondition

USARTx\_Initialize must have been called for the associated USART instance.

## Parameters

None.

## Returns

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|*true*|Receive hardware FIFO has at least one data available to read|
|*false*|Receive hardware FIFO is empty|

## Example

```c
char rxData;
if(USART1_ReceiverIsReady() == true)
{
    // At least one data is available in Receive FIFO, hence can read a byte
    rxData = USART1_ReadByte();
}
else
{
    //Receiver is empty
}
```

## Remarks

None.
