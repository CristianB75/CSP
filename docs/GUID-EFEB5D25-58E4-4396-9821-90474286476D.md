# DIVAS\_DivmodSigned Function

**Parent topic:**[Divide and Square Root Accelerator \(DIVAS\)](GUID-B166C830-24C9-4294-B2AB-EB296A821887.md)

## C

```c
uint64_t DIVAS_DivmodSigned(int32_t numerator, int32_t denominator)
```

## Summary

This function uses the DIVAS peripheral to performs a signed 32-bit division, and returns both the quotient and remainder as 64-bit number.

## Description

This function uses the DIVAS peripheral to perform a signed 32-bit division.<br />The function takes a signed divisor and dividend as input, and returns quotient and remainder as 64-bit number

## Precondition

The peripheral should have been initialized by calling the DIVAS\_Initialize\(\) function once.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|numerator|This should contain the signed dividend.|
|denominator|This should contain the signed divisor|

## Returns

Returns quotient and remainder as 64-bit number \(32-bit LSB is quotient and 32-bit MSB is remainder\).

## Example

```c
int32_t dividend;
int32_t divisor;
uint64_t divmod;

dividend = 10000;
divisor = -2000;

divmod = DIVAS_DivmodSigned(dividend, divisor)

```

## Remarks

None.
