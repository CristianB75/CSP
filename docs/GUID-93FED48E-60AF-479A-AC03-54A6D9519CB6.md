## C

```c
    typedef void (*XDMAC_CHANNEL_CALLBACK) (XDMAC_TRANSFER_EVENT event, uintptr_t contextHandle);

```

## Summary

Pointer to a XDMAC Transfer Event handler function.

## Description

This data type defines a XDMAC Transfer Event Handler Function.

A XDMAC PLIB client must register a transfer event handler function of this<br />type to receive transfer related events from the PLIB.

If the event is XDMAC\_TRANSFER\_EVENT\_COMPLETE, this means that the data<br />was transferred successfully.

If the event is XDMAC\_TRANSFER\_EVENT\_ERROR, this means that the data was<br />not transferred successfully.

The contextHandle parameter contains the context handle that was provided by<br />the client at the time of registering the event handler. This context handle<br />can be anything that the client consider helpful or necessary to identify<br />the client context object associated with the channel of the XDMAC PLIB that<br />generated the event.

The event handler function executes in an interrupt context of XDMAC.<br />It is recommended to the application not to perform process intensive<br />operations with in this function.

## Remarks

None.
