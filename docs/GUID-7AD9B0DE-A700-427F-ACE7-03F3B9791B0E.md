# Clock Generator \(CLOCK\)

The Clock system generates and distributes the clock for the processor<br />and peripherals

**Clock Generators:**

-   A low-power 32.768 kHz crystal oscillator

-   A low-power embedded 64 kHz \(typical\) RC oscillator generating the 32<br />kHz source clock

-   A 8 to 24 MHz crystal oscillator or a 12 to 48 MHz XRCGB crystal<br />resonator with Bypass mode

-   A 12 MHz embedded RC oscillator

-   A 480 MHz UTMI PLL providing a clock for the USB High-speed Device<br />Controller

-   A 600 to 1200 MHz programmable PLL \(input from 8 to 50 MHz\), provides<br />the clock to the processor and to the peripherals

-   A 700 MHz fractional-N programmable audio PLL, with 22-bit frequency<br />resolution and two independent programmable post dividers to drive the<br />CLK\_AUDIO output pin and the internal peripherals \(AUDIOPLLCLK\)


**Clock Distribution:**

-   Master clock controller sources processor clock controller and<br />generates Master Clock \(MCK\) which is the processor dependent clock to<br />all peripherals

-   Processor clock controller implements IDLE mode for processor clock

-   Matrix clock controller controls the clocks to the bus matrices

-   Programmable clock controller controls outputting clock to external<br />pins

-   Peripheral clock controller controls processor dependent clock to<br />all peripherals

-   Generic clock controller controls processor independent clocks to<br />peripherals that support it

-   LCD, ISC, DDR and USB host clock controllers control the processor<br />independent clocks to those peripherals


**Using The Library**

The Clock peripheral library initializes the clock system as configured<br />by the user in the MHC Clock configurator. It can be accessed via the<br />"Tools" drop down of the MPLAB harmony configurator menu bar.

**Library Interface**

Clock Generator peripheral library provides the following interfaces:
