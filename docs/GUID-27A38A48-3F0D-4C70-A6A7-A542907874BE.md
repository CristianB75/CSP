# SYSTICK\_TimerCallbackSet Function

**Parent topic:**[System timer \(SysTick\)](GUID-A4B9F359-3129-4377-B43E-71415C6B19F2.md)

## C

```c
void SYSTICK_TimerCallbackSet ( SYSTICK_CALLBACK callback, uintptr_t context )
```

## Summary

Sets the pointer to the function \(and it's context\) to be called when the given systick reaches 0.

## Description

This function sets the pointer to a client function to be called "back" when systick reaches 0. It also passes a context value \(usually a pointer to a context structure\) that is passed into the function when it is called.

This function is available only in interrupt or non-blocking mode of operation.

## Precondition

SYSTICK\_Initialize must have been called for the associated USART instance.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|callback|A pointer to a function with a calling signature defined by the SYSTICK\_CALLBACK data type.|
|context|A value \(usually a pointer\) passed \(unused\) into the function identified by the callback parameter.|

## Returns

None.

## Example

```c
ticks = 0;

void AppCallback ( uintptr_t context )
{
    ticks++;
}

SYSTICK_TimerCallbackSet(AppCallback, (uintptr_t) NULL);
```

## Remarks

The context parameter is ignored if the pointer passed is NULL. To disable the callback function, pass a NULL for the callback parameter.
