# Secure Embedded Flash Controller \(SEFC\)

The Secure Embedded Flash Controller \(SEFC\) manages the programming, erasing, locking and unlocking sequences of the Flash using a full set<br />of commands.

Security in the SEFC is based on access rights, secure key storage and a Private Key bus. The SEFC manages safety features,<br />including Error correction code and a self-check mechanism reported by the Flash block.

**Using The Library**

The main Flash memory can not be read while it is being erased or written, the CPU is stalled during the entire operation. All functions<br />that modify the main Flash can be run from RAM memory to avoid CPU stall while main main Flash is being erased or written.

The FLASH memory is divided into a number of physical rows, each containing four identically sized flash pages. Pages may be read or written to<br />individually, however pages must be erased before being reprogrammed and the smallest granularity available for erasure is one single row.

SEFC APIs are implemented to be non-blocking, the API will return immediately if not stalled by Flash operation. The user application can<br />either poll the status or get callback once the flash operation is completed.

-   With polling, the application will need to continuously check if the flash operation is completed

-   With callback, the registered callback function will be called once the flash operation is completed. This means the application do not have to poll continuously. The interrupt must be enabled in MCC for callback method


Here is an example code to erase a row and program a page of memory using polling method

```c
// Define a constant array in Flash.
// It must be aligned to sector boundary and size has to be in multiple of sectors
const uint8_t sefc0_user_start_address[SEFC0_SECTORSIZE] __attribute__((aligned(SEFC0_SECTORSIZE),keep,externally_visible,space(prog)))= {0};

void populate_buffer(uint8_t* data)
{
    int i = 0;

    for (i = 0; i < (SEFC0_PAGESIZE); i++)
    {
        *(data + i) = i;
    }
}

int main (void)
{
    uint8_t pageBuffer[SEFC0_PAGESIZE] = {0};

    /*Populate pageBuffer to programmed*/
    populate_buffer(pageBuffer);

    while(SEFC0_IsBusy());

    /*Erase the sector*/
    SEFC0_SectorErase(sefc0_user_start_address);

    /* Wait for erase operation to complete */
    while(SEFC0_IsBusy());

    /*Program a page*/
    SEFC0_PageWrite(pageBuffer, sefc0_user_start_address);

    /* Wait for page program to complete
    while(SEFC0_IsBusy());
}
```
