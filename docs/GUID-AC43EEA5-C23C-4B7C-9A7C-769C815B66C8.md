## C

```c
bool ADCx_ConversionSequenceIsFinished( void ) // x is instance of the peripheral and it is applicable only for devices having multiple instances of the peripheral.
```

## Summary

Returns the status of automatic sequence conversion.

## Description

This function checks the status of the conversion sequence.

## Precondition

ADC\_Initialize\(\) function must have been called first for the associated instance.And conversion must have been started.

## Parameters

None.
