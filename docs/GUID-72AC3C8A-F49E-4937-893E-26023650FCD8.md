**Parent topic:**[Controller Area Network \(CAN\)](GUID-9E2CB6D3-5052-4DCE-9DD7-68CC12674833.md)

## C

```c
bool CANx_TransmitEventFIFOElementGet(uint32_t *id, uint32_t *sequence, uint32_t *timestamp) // x - Instance of the CAN peripheral
```

## Summary

Get the Transmit Event FIFO Element for the transmitted message.

## Description

This routine gets the Transmit Event FIFO Element for the transmitted message.

## Precondition

CANx\_Initialize must have been called for the associated CAN instance.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|id|Pointer to 11-bit / 29-bit identifier \(ID\) to be received.|
|sequence|Pointer to Tx message sequence number to be received|
|timestamp|Pointer to Tx message timestamp to be received, timestamp value is 0 if Timestamp is disabled in CFD$\{CAN\_INSTANCE\_NUM\}TSCON|

## Returns

Request status.<br />*true* - Request was successful.

*false* - Request has failed.

## Example

```c
uint32_t id, sequence, timestamp;
if (CAN1_TransmitEventFIFOElementGet(&id, &sequence, &timestamp))
{
    // Received id, sequence and timestamp on request success
}
```

## Remarks
