## C

```c
// x - Instance of the QSPI peripheral

void QSPIx_CallbackRegister
(
const QSPIx_CALLBACK* callback,
uintptr_t context
);
```

## Summary

Allows application to register callback with PLIB. This is used in SPI mode only.

## Description

This function allows application to register a callback function for the PLIB to call back when requested data transfer operation has completed.

The callback should be registered before the client performs transfer operation. At any point if application wants to stop the callback, it can call this function with "callback" value as NULL.

## Precondition

The QSPIx\_Initialize function must have been called.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|callback|Pointer to the callback function implemented by the user|
|context|The value of parameter will be passed back to the applicationunchanged, when the callback function is called. It can be used to identify any application specific value that identifies the instance of the client module \(for example, it may be a pointer to the client module's state structure\).|

## Returns

None.

## Example

```c
void APP_QSPITransferHandler(uintptr_t context)
{
    //Transfer was completed without error, do something else now.
}

QSPI0_CallbackRegister(&APP_QSPITransferHandler, (uintptr_t)NULL);

```

## Remarks

If the client does not want to be notified when the queued operation has completed, it does not need to register a callback.
