**Parent topic:**[Non-maskable Interrupt Controller \(NMIC\)](GUID-FFDBEA51-E671-4664-A1C3-0E0A899FDF2D.md)

## C

```c
void NMIC_CallbackRegister( NMIC_CALLBACK callback, uintptr_t context )
```

## Summary

Sets the pointer to the function \(and it's context\) to be called when the Timeout events occur.

## Description

This function sets the pointer to a client function to be called "back" when the interrupt occurs. It also passes a context value that is passed into the function when it is called. This function is available only in interrupt mode of operation.

## Precondition

None.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|callback|A pointer to a function with a calling signature definedby the NMIC\_CALLBACK data type|
|context|A value \(usually a pointer\) passed \(unused\) into the functionidentified by the callback parameter|

## Returns

None.

## Example

```c
NMIC_CallbackRegister(MyCallback, &myData);
```

## Remarks

The context value may be set to NULL if it is not required. In this case the value NULL will be passed to the callback function. To disable the callback function, pass a NULL for the callback parameter. See the NMIC\_CALLBACK type definition for additional information.
