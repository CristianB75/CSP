# XDMACn\_ChannelLinkedListTransfer Function

**Parent topic:**[Extensible DMA Controller \(XDMAC\)](GUID-C2B02311-0F9A-41E7-92B8-C2FEEBDFE755.md)

## C

```c
// n is instance of the peripheral and it is applicable only for devices having multiple instances of the peripheral.
bool XDMACn_ChannelLinkedListTransfer
(
XDMAC_CHANNEL channel,
uint32_t descriptor,
XDMAC_DESCRIPTOR_CONTROL* descriptorControl
)
```

## Summary

Sets up a multi-block data transfer on a specified XDMAC channel using linked list feature.

## Description

This function sets up multi-block data transfer for a XDMAC channel by<br />linked list operation mode if channel is not busy already. That is each<br />block of data to be transferred is configured as descriptors of a linked list.<br />Each descriptor can be defined in any available descriptor view formats and<br />the views are available as XDMAC\_DESCRIPTOR\_VIEW\_x.

Specified XDMAC channel will be enabled by default upon linked list<br />addition. Upon each block transfer completion XDMAC PLIB will call event<br />handler if the event handler is registered through<br />XDMAC\_ChannelCallbackRegister.

## Precondition

XDMAC should have been initialized by calling XDMACn\_Initialize. Linked list with descriptors in any available descriptor view formats must be defined.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|channel|A specific XDMAC channel|
|firstDescriptorAddress|Address of the first descriptor of the linked list. All descriptors must be defined in the device specific view formats available as XDMAC\_DESCRIPTOR\_VIEW\_x and must be cache line aligned.|
|firstDescriptorControl|Control settings for the first descriptor. This must be defined in device specific view format, XDMAC\_DESCRIPTOR\_CONTROL and must be cache line aligned.|

## Returns

*- True* - If transfer request is accepted.

*- False* - If previous transfer is in progress and the request is rejected.

## Example

```c
// Transfer 2 blocks of data to UART TX, each 10 bytes.

//Two blocks of data
char src1[11] = {"1234567890"};
char src2[11] = {"ABCDEFGHIJ"};
    
    //Cache line aligned first descriptor control, "descptr_crtl"
    //Cache line aligned linked list with descriptors in any supported view,
    //"linkedList1[2]" with 2 descriptors of different source addresses.
    
    // User registers an event handler with PLIB.
    XDMAC_ChannelCallbackRegister(handle, APP_XDMAC_TransferEventHandler,
    NULL);
    
    // Add linked list to the XDMAC PLIB, channel will be enabled by default.
    if(XDMAC_ChannelLinkedListTransfer(XDMAC_CHANNEL_1, (uint32_t)&linkedList1[0], &descptr_crtl) == true)
    {
        // do something else
    }
    else
    {
        // try again?
    }
```

## Remarks

This is supported by only the devices with multi-block transfer feature. The "descriptorControl" parameter is a XDMAC hardware version specific requirement and may not be needed in some of the devices.
