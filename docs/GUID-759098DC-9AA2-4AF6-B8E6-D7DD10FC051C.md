## C

```c

/* USART SPI master mode */

typedef struct
{
    uint32_t                    clockFrequency;
    USART_SPI_CLOCK_PHASE       clockPhase;
    USART_SPI_CLOCK_POLARITY    clockPolarity;
    USART_SPI_DATA_BITS         dataBits;

}USART_SPI_TRANSFER_SETUP;

```

## Summary

Data structure containing the USART SPI parameters which can be changed at run time

## Description

This structure identifies the possible setup parameters for USART SPI which can be changed at run time. An instance of this structure is passed as a parameter to the USARTx\_SPI\_TransferSetup API.

## Remarks

None.
