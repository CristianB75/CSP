# Clock Generator \(CLOCK\)

The Clock system generates and distributes the clock for the processor<br />and peripherals.

**Clock Generators:**

-   3 to 20 MHz main crystal oscillator with bypass mode. 12 MHz or 16<br />MHz needed for USB operations

-   High-precision Main RC oscillator with 12 MHz default frequency

-   Low-power 32.768 kHz crystal oscillator with bypass mode

-   Low-power 32 kHz Slow RC Oscillator \(SLCK\)

-   160-500 MHz programmable PLL for system clock

-   480 MHz UTMI PLL providing clock to USB High-speed controller


**Clock Distribution**

-   Master clock controller generates Processor Clock \(HCLK\) and Master<br />Clock \(MCK\). The master clock \(MCK\) is the source clock for many<br />peripherals

-   The Peripheral Clock Controller enables and disables clocks to<br />different peripherals running from Master clock

-   Programmable Clock Controller \(PCK\) provides clock for USART, UART,<br />TC, Embedded Trace Macrocell \(ETM\), and CAN peripherals. The PCK is<br />independent of the processor clock and the master clock

-   Generic Clock Controller \(GCLK\) provides clock for I2S peripheral.<br />The GCLK is independent of the processor clock and the master clock


**Using The Library**

The Clock peripheral library initializes the clock system as configured<br />by the user in the MHC easy view.

**Library Interface**
