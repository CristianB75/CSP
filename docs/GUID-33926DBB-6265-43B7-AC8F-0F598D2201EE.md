# SERCOMx\_USART\_WriteCallbackRegister Function

**Parent topic:**[Serial Communication Interface \(SERCOM\)](GUID-76AE7205-E3EF-4EE6-AC28-5153E3565982.md)

## C

```c
/* x = SERCOM instance number */

/* Non-blocking mode */

void SERCOMx_USART_WriteCallbackRegister( SERCOM_USART_CALLBACK callback, uintptr_t context )

/* Ring buffer mode */

void SERCOMx_USART_WriteCallbackRegister( SERCOM_USART_RING_BUFFER_CALLBACK callback, uintptr_t context)
```

## Summary

Sets the pointer to the function \(and it's context\) to be called when the given USART's write events occur.

## Description

This function sets the pointer to a client function to be called "back" when the given USART's write events occur. It also passes a context value \(usually a pointer to a context structure\) that is passed into the function when it is called.

## Precondition

SERCOMx\_USART\_Initialize must have been called for the associated USART instance.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|callback|Pointer to the function to be called when the write transfer has completed. Setting this to NULL will disable the callback feature.|
|context|A value \(usually a pointer\) passed \(unused\) into the function identified by the callback parameter.|

## Returns

None.

## Example

*Non-blocking mode*

```c

void usartWriteEventHandler ( uintptr_t context )
{
    if(USART_ERROR_NONE != SERCOM0_USART_ErrorGet())
    {
        //Handle error case
    }
    else
    {
        //Transfer completed successfully
    }
}

SERCOM0_USART_WriteCallbackRegister(usartWriteEventHandler, (uintptr_t)NULL);
```

*Ring buffer mode*

```c

bool txThresholdEventReceived = false;

void usartWriteEventHandler(SERCOM_USART_EVENT event, uintptr_t context )
{
    if (event == SERCOM_USART_EVENT_WRITE_THRESHOLD_REACHED)
    {
        txThresholdEventReceived = true;
    }
}

SERCOM0_USART_WriteCallbackRegister(usartWriteEventHandler, (uintptr_t)NULL);
```

## Remarks

None
