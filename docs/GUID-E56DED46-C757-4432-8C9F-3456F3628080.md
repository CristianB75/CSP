## C

```c
/* x = FLEXCOM instance number */

/* TWI master mode and slave with interrupt enabled */

bool FLEXCOMx_TWI_IsBusy(void)	
```

## Summary

Returns the Peripheral busy status

## Description

*TWI master mode*

In master mode, this function returns true if the FLEXCOMx TWI module is busy with a transfer. The application can use this function to check if FLEXCOMx TWI module is busy before calling any of the data transfer functions. The library does not allow a data transfer operation if another transfer operation is already in progress.

*TWI slave mode*

In slave mode, the function returns true as soon as the address match event occurs and returns false after a STOP bit has been detected. The application can use this API to ensure no TWI transfer is in progress.

## Precondition

FLEXCOMx\_TWI\_Initialize must have been called for the associated FLEXCOM instance.

## Parameters

None.

## Returns

*true* - Busy

*false* - Not busy

## Example

```c
// wait for the current transfer to complete
while(FLEXCOM0_TWI_IsBusy());

```

## Remarks

None
