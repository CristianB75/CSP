# TCx\_CHy\_CaptureBGet Function

**Parent topic:**[Timer Counter \(TC\)](GUID-B7C79854-BBCD-49B3-9EA3-C379E6A5FCE0.md)

## C

```c
/* x = TC instance number, y = channel number */

/* 16 bit counter */
uint16_t TCx_CHy_CaptureBGet ( void )

/* 32 bit counter */
uint32_t TCx_CHy_CaptureBGet ( void )
```

## Summary

Returns the Capture-B value.

## Description

This function provides the Capture-B value that was stored when the selected event occurred on the input signal. The caller should call the TCx\_CHy\_CaptureBEventOccured function to identify if the Capture-B value has been updated by the selected signal event.

## Precondition

TCx\_CHy\_TimerInitialize function must have been called first for the given channel to configure channel in capture mode.

## Parameters

None

## Returns

Most recent Capture-B value. Type of the return value varies with the bit depth of the counter

## Example

16 bit counter

```c
uint16_t capture;

if (TC0_CH1_CaptureBEventOccured() == true)
{
    capture = TC0_CH1_CaptureBGet();
}
```

32 bit counter

```c
uint16_t capture;

if (TC0_CH1_CaptureBEventOccured() == true)
{
    capture = TC0_CH1_CaptureBGet();
}
```

## Remarks

This function is applicable only for capture mode.
