## C

```c
void SUPC_CallbackRegister( SUPC_CALLBACK callback, uintptr_t context )
```

## Summary

Registers the function to be called when a Brown Out Event has occurred.

## Description

This function registers the callback function to be called

This function allows application to register a callback function for the<br />PLIB to callback. The callback should be registered before the client<br />performs transfer operation.

On some devices this callback will be called when a interrupt occurred due<br />to Supply monitor detection.

On some devices this callback will be called when a Brown Out event has occurred.<br />Note that the callback function will be called only if the BOD33 action setting<br />is configured to generate an interrupt and not reset the system.

At any point if application wants to stop the callback, it can call this<br />function with "callback" value as NULL.

## Precondition

SUPC\_Initialize\(\) must have been called before registering a callback.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|callback|Pointer to the callback function|
|context|Allows the caller to provide a context value \(usually a pointer to the callers context for multi-instance clients\).|

## Returns

None.

## Example

```c
MY_APP_OBJ myAppObj;

void APP_SUPC_CallbackFunction (uintptr_t context)
{
    // The context was set to an application specific object.
    // It is now retrievable easily in the event handler.
    MY_APP_OBJ myAppObj = (MY_APP_OBJ *) context;

    //Application related tasks
}

SUPC_CallbackRegister(APP_SUPC_CallbackFunction, (uintptr_t)&myAppObj);
```

## Remarks

Context value can be set to NULL if not required. To disable callback function, pass NULL for the callback parameter
