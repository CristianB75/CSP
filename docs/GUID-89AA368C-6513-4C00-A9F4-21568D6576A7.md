# USARTx\_TransmitterIsReady Function

**Parent topic:**[Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver Transceiver \(USART\)](GUID-5ED4F08A-8227-486D-9727-78BD47CA0866.md)

## C

```c
/* x = USART instance number */

/* Blocking mode */
bool USARTx_TransmitterIsReady( void )
```

## Summary

Returns the hardware status of the USART Transmit FIFO.

## Description

This function returns the hardware status associated with the transmit hardware FIFO of the given USART peripheral instance. When the transmitter is ready, user can submit data to be transmitted. This function is available only in blocking \(non-interrupt\) mode of operation. It can be used to achieve non-blocking behavior of write request in the non-interrupt mode. If non-blocking behavior is desired, this function should be called to check if the transmitter is ready and then the USART\_Write function should be called with a buffer size of 1.

## Precondition

USARTx\_Initialize must have been called for the associated USART instance.

## Parameters

None.

## Returns

*true* - if transmit hardware FIFO has empty space to accept data.

*false* - if transmit hardware FIFO is full.

## Example

```c
if(true == USART1_TransmitterIsReady())
{
    // Empty space is available in Transmitter FIFO, hence can write a byte
    USART1_WriteByte('A');
}
else
{
    //Transmitter is busy
}
```

## Remarks

None.
