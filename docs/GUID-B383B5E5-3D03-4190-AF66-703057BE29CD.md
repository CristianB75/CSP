## Summary

Puts the device into Backup mode

## Description

This functions is used to put the device into Backup mode to achieve the<br />lowest power consumption possible in a system which is performing periodic<br />wakeup to perform tasks but not requiring fast startup time.

The Supply Controller, zero-power power-on reset, RTT, RTC, backup SRAM,<br />backup registers and 32 kHz oscillator \(RC or crystal oscillator selected by<br />software in the Supply Controller\) are running. The regulator and the core<br />supply are off.

Exit from Backup mode occurs as a result of one of the following enabled<br />wakeup events and it causes device reset:

-   WKUP0 to WKUP13 pins \(level transition, configurable debouncing\)

-   Supply Monitor alarm

-   RTC alarm

-   RTT alarm


## Precondition

The peripherals \(Supply Monitor, RTT, RTC etc\) must be configured to generate wakeup event.

## Parameters

None

## Returns

None.

## Example

```c
SUPC_BackupModeEnter ();
```

## Remarks

None.
