# USART\_EVENT Enum

**Parent topic:**[Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver Transceiver \(USART\)](GUID-5ED4F08A-8227-486D-9727-78BD47CA0866.md)

## C

```c

/* Ring buffer mode */

typedef enum
{
    /* Threshold number of bytes are available in the receive ring buffer */
    USART_EVENT_READ_THRESHOLD_REACHED,
    
    /* Receive ring buffer is full. Application must read the data out to avoid missing data on the next RX interrupt. */
    USART_EVENT_READ_BUFFER_FULL,
    
    /* USART error. Application must call the USARTx_ErrorGet API to get the type of error and clear the error. */
    USART_EVENT_READ_ERROR,
    
    /* Threshold number of free space is available in the transmit ring buffer */
    USART_EVENT_WRITE_THRESHOLD_REACHED,
}USART_EVENT;

```

## Summary

Defines the enums associated with the USART events in the ring buffer mode

## Description

Defines the data type for the USART events. One of these event types is passed back into the registered callback that lets the application know the type of event for which the callback is given.

## Remarks

None.
