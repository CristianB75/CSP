## C

The GPIO Pins vary based on device family. Refer to the generated header file for the actual values.

## Summary

Identifies the available GPIO port pins.

## Description

This enumeration identifies the available GPIO port pins.

## Remarks

The caller should not rely on the specific numbers assigned to any of these values as they may change from one processor to the next. Not all pins are available on all devices. Refer to the specific device data sheet to determine which pins are supported.
