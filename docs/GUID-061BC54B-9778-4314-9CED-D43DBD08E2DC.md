## C

```c
typedef void (*DMAC_CHANNEL_CALLBACK) (DMAC_TRANSFER_EVENT status, uintptr_t contextHandle);

```

## Summary

Pointer to a DMAC Transfer Event handler function.

## Description

This data type defines a DMAC Transfer Event Handler Function. A DMAC PLIB<br />client must register a transfer event handler function of this type to<br />receive transfer related events from the PLIB.

If the event is DMAC\_TRANSFER\_EVENT\_COMPLETE, this means that the data<br />was transferred successfully.

If the event is DMAC\_TRANSFER\_EVENT\_ERROR, this means that the data was<br />not transferred successfully.

The contextHandle parameter contains the context handle that was provided by<br />the client at the time of registering the event handler. This context handle<br />can be anything that the client considers helpful or necessary to identify<br />the client context associated with the DMAC channel that generated the<br />event.

The event handler function executes in an interrupt context of DMAC. It is<br />recommended to the application not to perform process intensive operations<br />with in this function.

## Remarks

None.
