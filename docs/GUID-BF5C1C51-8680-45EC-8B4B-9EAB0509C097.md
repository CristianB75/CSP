# HEMC\_FixCallbackRegister Function

**Parent topic:**[Hardened External Memory Controller \(HEMC\)](GUID-1503BB87-D5B3-4C8C-A91F-2AA286252046.md)

## C

```c
void HEMC_FixCallbackRegister(HEMC_CALLBACK callback, uintptr_t context)
```

## Summary

Sets the pointer to the function \(and it's context\) to be called when the given HEMC's ECC Fixable Error interrupt events occur.

## Description

This function sets the pointer to a client function to be called "back" when the given HEMC's interrupt events occur. It also passes a context value \(usually a pointer to a context structure\) that is passed into the function when it is called. The specified callback function will be called from the peripheral interrupt context.

## Precondition

HEMC\_Initialize must have been called for the associated HEMC instance.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|callback|A pointer to a function with a calling signature defined bythe HEMC\_CALLBACK data type. Setting this to NULL disables the callback feature|
|context|A value \(usually a pointer\) passed \(unused\) into thefunction identified by the callback parameter|

## Returns

None.

## Example

```c
void APP_HEMC_FixHandler(uintptr_t context)
{
    //Fixable error has occurred
}

HEMC_FixCallbackRegister(&APP_HEMC_FixHandler, (uintptr_t)NULL);
```

## Remarks

None.
