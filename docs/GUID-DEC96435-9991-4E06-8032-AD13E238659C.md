## C

```c
void RTC_Timer32Stop ( void )
```

## Summary

Stops the 32-bit timer from counting.

## Description

This function will stop the 32-bit timer from counting. Any on-going timing/counting operations will be affected. Stopping the timer does not reset the counter. This must be explicitly done by calling the RTC\_Timer32CounterSet\(\) function.

Calling this function if the timer is already stopped will result in a functional no-operation. An application may need to stop the timer if it does not require delay services or if the counting needs to paused.

## Precondition

RTC\_Initialize must have been called for the associated RTC instance. The RTC peripheral should have been configured in 32-bit Timer Counter mode.

## Parameters

None.

## Returns

None.

## Example

```c
// Refer to the description of the RTC_Timer32CounterHasOverflowed()
// function for example usage of the RTC_Timer32Stop() function.

```

## Remarks

None.
