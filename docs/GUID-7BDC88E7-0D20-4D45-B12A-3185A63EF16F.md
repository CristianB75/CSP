## C

```c
void PIO_PortInterruptDisable(PIO_PORT port, uint32_t mask)
```

## Summary

Disables IO interrupt on selected IO pins of a port.

## Description

This function disables IO interrupt on selected IO pins of selected port.

## Precondition

Corresponding pins must be configured in interrupt mode in MHC Pin Manager. PIO\_Initialize\(\) must have been called.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|port|One of the IO ports from the enum PIO\_PORT|
|mask|Is a 32 bit value in which positions of 0s and 1s decide which IO pins of the selected port will have interrupt disabled.|

-   The bit positions of mask value which are set as 1, IO interrupt of corresponding IO pin of the selected port will be disabled.

-   The bit positions of mask value which are cleared to 0, IO interrupt of corresponding IO pin of the selected port will remain unchanged.


## Returns

None.

## Example

```c
// Disable IO interrupt for PB9 and PB1 pins
PIO_PortInterruptDisable(PIO_PORT_C, 0x0202);
```

## Remarks

None.
