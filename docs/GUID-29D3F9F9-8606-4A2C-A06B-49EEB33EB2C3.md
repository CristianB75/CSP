# MEM2MEM\_CALLBACK Typedef

**Parent topic:**[Memory to Memory \(MEM2MEM\)](GUID-692A056B-1150-4194-963B-E39865A3B3C3.md)

## C

```c
typedef void (*MEM2MEM_CALLBACK) (MEM2MEM_TRANSFER_EVENT event, uintptr_t context);

```

## Summary

Pointer to a MEM2MEM Transfer Event handler function.

## Description

This data type defines a MEM2MEM Transfer Event Handler Function. A MEM2MEM<br />PLIB client must register a transfer event handler function of this type to<br />receive transfer related events from the PLIB.

If the event is MEM2MEM\_TRANSFER\_EVENT\_COMPLETE, this means that the data<br />was transferred successfully.

If the event is MEM2MEM\_TRANSFER\_EVENT\_ERROR, this means that the data was<br />not transferred successfully.

The context parameter contains the context handle that was provided by<br />the client at the time of registering the event handler. This context handle<br />can be anything that the client considers helpful or necessary to identify<br />the client context associated with the MEM2MEM channel that generated the<br />event.

The event handler function executes in an interrupt context of MEM2MEM. It is<br />recommended to the application not to perform process intensive operations<br />with in this function.

## Remarks

None.
