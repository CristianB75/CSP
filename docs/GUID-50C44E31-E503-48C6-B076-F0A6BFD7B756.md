# TWIHSx\_IsBusy Function

**Parent topic:**[Two-wire Interface - TWIHS](GUID-C8012FE8-F7B4-4CE6-84B4-61EAAFAB03B0.md)

## C

```c
/* x = TWIHS instance number */

/* TWIHS master mode and slave with interrupt enabled */
bool TWIHSx_IsBusy(void)
```

## Summary

Returns the peripheral busy status

## Description

*TWIHS master mode*

In master mode, this function returns true if the TWIHSx module is busy with a transfer. The application can use this function to check if TWIHSx module is busy before calling any of the data transfer functions. The library does not allow a data transfer operation if another transfer operation is already in progress.

*TWIHS slave mode*

In slave mode, the function returns true as soon as the address match event occurs and returns false after a STOP bit has been detected. The application can use this API to ensure no TWIHS transfer is in progress.

## Precondition

TWIHSx\_Initialize must have been called for the associated TWIHS instance.

## Parameters

None.

## Returns

*true* - Busy

*false* - Not busy

## Example

```c
// wait for the current transfer to complete
while(TWIHS1_IsBusy());

```

## Remarks

None
