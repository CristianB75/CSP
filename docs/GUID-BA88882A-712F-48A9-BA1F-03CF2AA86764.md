# Static Memory Controller \(SMC\)

\[/topic/body/p/color \{"- topic/color "\}\)The Static Memory Controller \(SMC\) is part of the External Bus Interface \(EBI\). The EBI is a highly flexible module for interfacing external memories and memory addressable peripherals such as LCD controllers and advanced communication controllers. The EBI module has four separate Chip Select blocks with individual address ranges and wait state control. Additional Chip Select lines can be decoded externally.\(color\]

\[/topic/body/p/color \{"- topic/color "\}\)The SMC handles several types of external memory and peripheral devices, such as SRAM, PSRAM, PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, LCD Module, NOR Flash, and NAND Flash.\(color\]

\[/topic/body/p/color \{"- topic/color "\}\)The SMC generates the signals that control the access to the external memory devices or peripheral devices. It has four chip selects, a 24-bit address bus, and a configurable 8-bit or 16-bit data bus. Separate read and write control signals allow for direct memory and peripheral interfacing. Read and write signal waveforms are fully adjustable.\(color\]
