# USARTx\_WriteCountGet Function

**Parent topic:**[Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver Transceiver \(USART\)](GUID-5ED4F08A-8227-486D-9727-78BD47CA0866.md)

## C

```c
/* x = USART instance number */

/* Non-blocking and ring buffer mode */

size_t USARTx_WriteCountGet( void )
```

## Summary

*Non-blocking mode*

Gets the byte count of processed bytes for a given USART write operation

*Ring buffer mode*

Returns the number of bytes pending to be transmitted out in the transmit buffer.

## Description

*Non-blocking mode*

This function gets the count of processed bytes for an on-going or last completed USART Transmit operation. This function can be used to track the progress of the non-blocking transmit operation.

*Ring buffer mode*

This function returns the number of bytes of data pending for transmission.

## Precondition

USARTx\_Initialize must have been called for the associated USART instance.

## Parameters

None.

## Returns

*Non-blocking mode*

Returns count of bytes currently completed/processed from the current transmit buffer for interrupt non-blocking mode. In 9-bit mode, it returns the number of 9-bit data processed.

*Ring buffer mode*

The API returns the number of bytes that are pending for transmission in the internal transmit buffer. If 9-bit mode is enabled, then the return value indicates the number of 9-bit data pending transmission.

## Example

*Non-blocking mode*

```c
size_t count;

count = USART1_WriteCountGet();

if(count < COUNT_EXPECTED)
{
    //More bytes are expected to transmit, wait
}
```

*Ring buffer mode*

```c
if (USART1_WriteCountGet() == 0)
{
    // All the data has been transmitted out.
}
```

## Remarks

None
