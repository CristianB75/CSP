# AHB Bus Matrix \(MATRIX\)

The Bus Matrix \(MATRIX\) implements a multi-layer AHB , based on the AHB-Lite protocol, that enables parallel access paths between multiple masters and slaves in a system, thus increasing the overall bandwidth.

The MATRIX interconnects up to 16 masters to up to 16 slaves. The normal latency to connect a master to a slave is one cycle, except for the default master of the accessed slave which is connected directly \(zero cycle latency\).

**Using The Library**

Matrix initializes AHB Masters and Slaves by invoking Matrix\_Initialize\(\) function in the system initialization.

**Library Interface**

AHB Bus Matrix peripheral library provides the following interfaces:
