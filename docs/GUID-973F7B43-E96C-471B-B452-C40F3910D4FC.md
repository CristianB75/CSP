# DBGU\_CALLBACK Typedef

**Parent topic:**[Debug Unit \(DBGU\)](GUID-97C41240-2AC0-4D05-A97E-83EB780C57A2.md)

## C

```c

/* Non-blocking mode */

typedef void (*DBGU_CALLBACK)( uintptr_t context );

```

## Summary

Defines the data type and function signature of the DBGU peripheral library callback function.

## Description

This data type defines the function signature of the DBGU peripheral callback function. The DBGU peripheral will call back the client's function with this signature to notify the application when a transfer has completed or when a transfer error has occured.

## Precondition

DBGU\_Initialize must have been called for the given DBGU peripheral instance and DBGU\_CallbackRegister must have been called to set the function to be called.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|context|Allows the caller to provide a context value \(usually a pointer to the callers context for multiple clients\).|

## Returns

None.

## Example

```c
void DBGUReadCallback(uintptr_t context)
{
    // This function will be called when a DBGU read has completed.
}

void DBGUWriteCallback(uintptr_t context)
{
    // This function will be called when a DBGU write has completed.
}

DBGU_ReadCallbackRegister(DBGUReadCallback, 0);
DBGU_WriteCallbackRegister(DBGUWriteCallback, 0);
```

## Remarks

None.
