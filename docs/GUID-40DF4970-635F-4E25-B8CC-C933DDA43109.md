# DBGU\_ReceiverIsReady Function

**Parent topic:**[Debug Unit \(DBGU\)](GUID-97C41240-2AC0-4D05-A97E-83EB780C57A2.md)

## C

```c

/* Blocking mode */

bool DBGU_ReceiverIsReady( void )
```

## Summary

Returns the hardware status of the DBGU Receiver

## Description

This function returns the hardware status associated with the Receive hardware FIFO of the given DBGU peripheral instance. When Receiver is ready, user can read the available data. This function is available only in blocking \(non-interrupt\) mode of operation. It can be used to achieve non-blocking behavior of DBGU\_Read function even if the library is configured for blocking behavior. If this function returns true, calling the DBGU\_Read function with a byte count of 1 will result in non-blocking behavior.

## Precondition

DBGU\_Initialize must have been called for the associated DBGU instance.

## Parameters

None.

## Returns

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|*true*|Receive hardware FIFO has at least one data available to read|
|*false*|Receive hardware FIFO is empty|

## Example

```c
char rxData;

if(DBGU_ReceiverIsReady() == true)
{
    // At least one data is available in Receive FIFO, hence can read a byte
    DBGU_Read(&rxData, 1);
}
else
{
    //Receiver is empty
}
```

## Remarks

None
