**Parent topic:**[Flexible Serial Communication Controller \(FLEXCOM\)](GUID-1F0CC449-4122-4C77-A199-A7874C524FDD.md)

## C

```c
/* x = FLEXCOM instance number */

/* Non-blocking mode */

bool FLEXCOMx_USART_WriteIsBusy( void )
```

## Summary

Returns the write request status associated with the given USART peripheral instance

## Description

This function returns the write request status associated with the given USART peripheral instance. It can be used to check the completion status of the FLEXCOMx\_USART\_Write\(\) function when the library is configured for non-blocking \(interrupt\) mode. In that, the function can be used as an alternative to using a callback function to check for completion.

## Precondition

FLEXCOMx\_USART\_Initialize must have been called for the associated USART instance.

## Parameters

None.

## Returns

*true* - USART is busy in processing the previous write request.

*false* - USART is free and ready to accept a new write request.

## Example

```c
if(FLEXCOM0_USART_WriteIsBusy() == true)
{
    //USART is currently processing the previous write request.
    //Wait to submit new request.
}

```

## Remarks

None
