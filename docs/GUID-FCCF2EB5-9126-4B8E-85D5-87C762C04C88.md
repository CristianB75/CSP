## C

```c
void RNG_LoadSet (void);
```

## Summary

Sets the LOAD bit in RNGCON register.

## Description

This function sets the LOAD bit in RNGCON register which triggers loading<br />of the seed for PRNG from RNGSEEDx registers of the TRNG.

## Precondition

RNG\_Initialize must have been called before using this function. Before calling RNG\_LoadSet\(\), call RNG\_WaitForTrngCnt\(\) to ensure that the seed contains the required number of valid bits.

## Parameters

None.

## Returns

None.

## Example

```c
RNG_LoadSet();
```

## Remarks

Calling RNG\_LoadSet\(\) also triggers generation of a new true random number in the TRNG.
