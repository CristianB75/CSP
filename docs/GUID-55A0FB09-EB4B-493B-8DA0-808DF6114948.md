## Summary

Defines the data type for the SQI DMA based transfer.

## Description

SQI DMA Descriptor structure should be used to to create the dma descriptors for SQI DMA based transfers. Multiple descriptor object of this type can be chained and used with a single request to SQIx\_DMATransfer\(\).

## Remarks

None.
