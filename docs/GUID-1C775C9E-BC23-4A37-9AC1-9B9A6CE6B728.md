# Clock Generator \(CLOCK\)

The PIC32MX clock system has the following modules and features:

-   A Total of Five External and Internal Oscillator Options as Clock<br />Sources

-   On-Chip PLL with User-Selectable Multiplier and Output<br />Divider to Boost Operating Frequency on Select Internal and External<br />Oscillator Sources

-   On-Chip User-Selectable Divisor Postscaler on Select<br />Oscillator Sources

-   Software-Controllable Switching between Various Clock Sources

-   A Fail-Safe Clock Monitor \(FSCM\) that Detects Clock Failure and<br />Permits Safe Application Recovery or Shutdown

-   Flexible Reference Clock Output
