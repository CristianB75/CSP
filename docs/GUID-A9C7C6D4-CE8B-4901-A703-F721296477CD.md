## C

```c
bool RTC_Timer16CounterHasOverflowed ( void )
```

## Summary

Checks if the 16-bit counter has overflowed

## Description

This function returns true if the counter value has matched the configured 16-bit timer period. The counter will be reset and start counting again.

The API can be used to poll period completion when using the timer counter as a timer. Calling the function will clear the internal period match flags if these flags were set at the time of calling the function.

## Precondition

RTC\_Initialize, RTC\_Timer16Start and RTC\_Timer16PeriodSet must have been called for the associated RTC instance. The RTC peripheral should have been configured in 16-bit Timer Counter mode.

## Parameters

None.

## Returns

True, if counter has overflowed, False otherwise.

## Example

```c
bool counterOverflowed = false;
RTC_Initialize();
RTC_Timer16PeriodSet(0x3000);
RTC_Timer16CounterSet(0);
RTC_Timer16Start();
do
{
    counterOverflowed = RTC_Timer16CounterHasOverflowed();
}
```

## Remarks

None.
