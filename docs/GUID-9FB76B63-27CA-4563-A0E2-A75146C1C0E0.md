**Parent topic:**[Serial Communication Interface \(SERCOM\)](GUID-76AE7205-E3EF-4EE6-AC28-5153E3565982.md)

## C

```c
/* x = SERCOM instance number */

/* I2C master mode and slave in interrupt mode */

bool SERCOMx_I2C_IsBusy(void)	
```

## Summary

Returns the Peripheral busy status

## Description

*I2C master mode*

In master mode, this function returns true if the FLEXCOMx TWI module is busy with a transfer. The application can use this function to check if FLEXCOMx TWI module is busy before calling any of the data transfer functions. The library does not allow a data transfer operation if another transfer operation is already in progress.

*I2C slave mode*

In slave mode, the function returns true as soon as the address match event occurs and returns false after a STOP bit has been detected. The application can use this API to ensure no TWI transfer is in progress.

## Precondition

SERCOMx\_I2C\_Initialize must have been called for the associated SERCOM instance.

## Parameters

None.

## Returns

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|true|Busy|
|false|Not busy|

## Example

```c
// wait for the current transfer to complete
while(SERCOM0_I2C_IsBusy( ));

```

## Remarks

None.
