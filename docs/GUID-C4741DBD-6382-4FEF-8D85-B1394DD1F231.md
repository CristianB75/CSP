## Summary

MCAN Error DLEC\_BIT0

## Description

Data Phase - During transmission of a message \(or acknowledge bit, or active error flag, or<br />overload flag\), the device tried to send a dominant level \(data or identifier bit logical<br />value ‘0’\), but the monitored bus value was recessive. During Bus\_Off recovery, this<br />status is set each time a sequence of 11 recessive bits has been monitored. This<br />enables the processor to monitor the proceeding of the Bus\_Off recovery sequence<br />\(indicating the bus is not stuck at dominant or continuously disturbed\).

## Remarks

None.
