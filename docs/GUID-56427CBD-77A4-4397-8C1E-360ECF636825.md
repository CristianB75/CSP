```c
void RTC_CallbackRegister( RTC_CALLBACK callback, uintptr_t context )
```

## Summary

Sets the pointer to the function \(and it's context\) to be called when the Timeout events occur.

## Description

This function sets the pointer to a client function to be called "back" when the Alarm occurs, It also passes a context value that is passed into the function when it is called. This function is available only in interrupt mode of operation.

## Precondition

None.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|callback|A pointer to a function with a calling signature defined by the RTC\_CALLBACK data type|

## Example
