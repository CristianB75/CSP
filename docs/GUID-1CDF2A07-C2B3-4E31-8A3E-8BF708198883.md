# FREQM\_FrequencyGet Function

**Parent topic:**[Frequency Meter \(FREQM\)](GUID-53DC3148-AECB-4E2B-B44D-152A975A542B.md)

## C

```c
uint32_t FREQM_FrequencyGet(void)
```

## Summary

Returns the measured frequency in Hz.

## Description

This function returns the measured frequency in Hz. It should be called when a frequency measurement is complete and no errors have occurred. This function is non-blocking. In this mode, the function should be called only after a callback function was called. The return value of the function is only valid if the FREQM\_ErrorGet\(\) function returns FREQM\_ERROR\_NONE.

## Precondition

FREQM\_Initialize\(\) and FREQM\_MeasurementStart\(\) functions should be called.

## Parameters

None.

## Returns

Returns frequency value of the measured clock. The value is only valid if the FREQM\_ErrorGet\(\) function returns FREQM\_ERROR\_NONE.

## Example

```c
// Refer to the code example of FREQM_CallbackRegister() function for guidance on interrupt based operation.
// The following code snippet shows an exampl of non-interrupt based operation.

FREQM_Initialize();
FREQM_MeasurementStart()

// Wait till the measurement is complete.
while(FREQM_IsBusy());

if(FREQM_ERROR_NONE == FREQM_ErrorGet())
{
    measuredFrequency = FREQM_FrequencyGet();
    // This means there are no errors and the value contained in
    // measuredFrequency is valid.
}
```

## Remarks

None.
