# Clock Generator \(CLOCK\)

\[/topic/body/p/color \{"- topic/color "\}\)The Clock Generator is made up of:\(color\]

-   \[/topic/body/ul/li/p/color \{"- topic/color "\}\)A low-power 32768 Hz slow clock oscillator with Bypass mode\(color\]

-   \[/topic/body/ul/li/p/color \{"- topic/color "\}\)A low-power RC oscillator\(color\]

-   \[/topic/body/ul/li/p/color \{"- topic/color "\}\)A 3 to 20 MHz crystal or ceramic resonator-based oscillator, which can be bypassed.\(color\]

-   \[/topic/body/ul/li/p/color \{"- topic/color "\}\)A factory-programmed fast RC oscillator. Three \\output frequencies can be selected: 8/16/24 MHz. By default 8 MHz is selected.\(color\]

-   \[/topic/body/ul/li/p/color \{"- topic/color "\}\)A 24 to 96 MHz programmable PLL \(input from 32 to 1000 KHz\), capable of providing the clock MCK to the processor and to the peripherals.\(color\]


\[/topic/body/p/color \{"- topic/color "\}\)It provides the following clocks:\(color\]

-   \[/topic/body/ul/li/p/color \{"- topic/color "\}\)SLCK, the slow clock, which is the only permanent clock within the system.\(color\]

-   \[/topic/body/ul/li/p/color \{"- topic/color "\}\)MAINCK is the output of the main clock oscillator selection: either the crystal or ceramic resonator-based oscillator or 8/16/24 MHz fast RC oscillator.\(color\]

-   \[/topic/body/ul/li/p/color \{"- topic/color "\}\)PLLACK is the output of the 24 to 96 MHz programmable PLL \(PLLA\).\(color\]


**Using The Library**

The Clock peripheral library initializes the clock system as configured<br />by the user in the MHC Clock configurator. It can be accessed via the<br />"Tools" drop down of the MPLAB harmony configurator menu bar.

**Library Interface**

Clock Generator peripheral library provides the following interfaces:
