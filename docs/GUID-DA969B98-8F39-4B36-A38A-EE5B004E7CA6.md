# Reset Controller \(RSTC\)

The Reset Controller collects the various reset sources and generates<br />reset for the device and allows the reset source to be identified by<br />the software.

-   **Power On Reset:**The device contains a poweronreset<br />\(POR\) detector, which keeps the system reset until power is stable.<br />This eliminates the need for external reset circuitry to guarantee<br />stable operation when powering up the device.

-   **Brown Out CORE Reset:**BOD12 will reset the device if a<br />voltage of 1.2 V or below is observed on the I/O pin supplying power to<br />the MCU core \(VDDCORE\).

-   **Brown Out VDD Reset:** BOD33 resets the device if the voltage<br />on the VDDANA pin falls below a value configured by the SYSCTRL

-   **Watchdog Reset:** The watchdog reset occurs when it times out

-   **System Reset:**The System Reset Request is a software reset<br />generated by the CPU when asserting the SYSRESETREQ bit located in the<br />Reset Control register of the CPU

-   **External Reset:**A external reset is generated when a low<br />level is detected on the RESET pin


Resets are divided into two modes based upon the source of the reset.

-   Power Resets include resets generated by POR, BOD12, and BOD33.

-   User Resets consist of the external reset, WDT, and the software<br />reset instruction


Both power and user reset causes the device to restart and set most<br />registers of the MCU to a preset state. The difference between the two<br />modes is how they affect the Real Time Clock, the 32 K oscillator, and<br />the WDT. The underlying reasoning for having two reset modes is to<br />protect the operation of the WDT and the RTC from nonpower related<br />anomalies.
