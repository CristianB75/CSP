# SERCOM\_SPI\_CALLBACK Typedef

**Parent topic:**[Serial Communication Interface \(SERCOM\)](GUID-76AE7205-E3EF-4EE6-AC28-5153E3565982.md)

## C

```c

/* SPI master (non-blocking mode) mode */
typedef void (*SERCOM_SPI_CALLBACK) (uintptr_t context)

```

## Summary

Defines the data type and function signature for the SERCOM SPI peripheral callback function.

## Description

This data type defines the function signature for the SERCOM SPI peripheral callback function. The SERCOM SPI peripheral will call back the client's function with this signature when the SERCOM SPI Transfer has completed.

## Precondition

SERCOMx\_SPI\_Initialize must have been called for the given SERCOM SPI peripheral instance and SERCOMx\_SPI\_CallbackRegister must have been called to set the function to be called. The callback register function should have been called before a read, write or transfer function has been initiated.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|context|Allows the caller to provide a context value \(usually a pointerto the callers context for multi-instance clients\).|

## Returns

None.

## Example

```c
SERCOM0_SPI_CallbackRegister(&APP_SPITransferHandler, NULL);

void APP_SPITransferHandler(uintptr_t context)
{
    //Transfer completed
}
```

## Remarks

None.
