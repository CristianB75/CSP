# SUPC\_BOD33\_CALLBACK Typedef

**Parent topic:**[Supply Controller \(SUPC\)](GUID-CAEF0560-90E6-45AA-96D0-FAEAF26EDC48.md)

## C

```c
typedef void (*SUPC_BOD33_CALLBACK)( uintptr_t context );

```

## Summary

Defines the data type and function signature for the SUPC peripheral callback function.

## Description

This data type defines the function signature for the SUPC peripheral<br />callback function. The SUPC peripheral library will call back the client's<br />function with this signature when a Brown Out event has been detected.<br />The function will be called only if the BOD33 action in the NVM user row<br />is set to interrupt.

## Remarks

SUPC\_Initialize\(\) must have been called for the supc peripheral before registering a callback. SUPC\_BOD33CallbackRegister\(\) must have been called to set the function to be called.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|context|Allows the caller to provide a context value \(usually a pointer to the callers context for multi-instance clients\).|

## Returns

None.

## Example

```c
void APP_BrownOutEventHandler( uintptr_t context )
{
    // Code to perform any quick action before the supply dies.
}

SUPC_BOD33CallbackRegister(APP_BrownOutEventHandler, 0);
```

## Remarks

None.
