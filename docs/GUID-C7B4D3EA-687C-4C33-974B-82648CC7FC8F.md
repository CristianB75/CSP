# EFC\_QuadWordWrite Function

**Parent topic:**[Embedded Flash Controller \(EFC\)](GUID-9D57DC2E-2BF0-4D75-9E5E-FE57C7CDCC4C.md)

## C

```c
bool EFC_QuadWordWrite( uint32_t* data, uint32_t address )
```

## Summary

Writes a 128-bit data to a given address in FLASH memory.

## Description

This function takes a 32-bit address, a pointer to the 128-bit data and writes it to the given location in FLASH memory.

## Precondition

Validate if EFC controller is ready to accept new request by calling EFC\_IsBusy\(\) The Memory to be written should be in Erased State.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|address|FLASH address to be modified|
|data|pointer to 128-bit data buffer|

## Returns

Always returns true.

## Example

```c
uint32_t data[4];

data[0] = 0x12345678;
data[1] = 0x87654321;
data[2] = 0x12345678;
data[3] = 0x87654321;

EFC_QuadWordWrite((uint32_t *) data, 0x500000);

while(EFC_IsBusy());

```

## Remarks

Application needs to poll for busy bit or wait for callback to be called before sending next request.
