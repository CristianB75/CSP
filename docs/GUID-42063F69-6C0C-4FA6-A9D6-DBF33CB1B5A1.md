## C

```c
uint16_t RTC_Timer16PeriodGet ( void )
```

## Summary

Get 16-bit timer period Value.

## Description

This function returns the 16-bit timer period value which used to compare with the current counter value. This value will match the value that was set using the RTC\_Timer16PeriodSet\(\) function.

## Precondition

RTC\_Initialize must have been called for the associated RTC instance. The RTC peripheral should have been configured in 16-bit Timer Counter mode

## Parameters

None.

## Returns

The current 16-bit timer period value.

## Example

```c
uint16_t period = 0;
RTC_Initialize();
RTC_Timer16PeriodSet(0xFFF);

// period will have the same value is 0xFFF.
period = RTC_Timer16PeriodGet();

```
