# CRCCUx\_CRCCalculate Function

**Parent topic:**[Cyclic Redundancy Check Calculation Unit \(CRCCU\)](GUID-DFABB32F-CEF4-4705-8A6A-C1552576BF69.md)

## C

```c
// x - Instance of the CRCCU peripheral

bool CRCCUx_CRCCalculate
(
uint32_t startAddress,
uint16_t length,
uint32_t * crc,
bool chain
);
```

## Summary

Calculates the CRC Value for the specified address range.

## Description

This function uses the CRCCU to calculate the CRC on a memory block.<br />The start address and the size of the memory block are specified<br />by startAddress and the size parameters.

For calculating the CRC of non-contiguous memory blocks, the chain parameter<br />must be set to true.

The calcualted CRC is returned in the crc parameter. This should be<br />inverted to match standard CRC implementations. It should be kept<br />non-inverted if used as a starting point for subsequent CRC<br />calculations.

## Precondition

CRCCU\_Initialize\(\) function must have been called first for the associated instance.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|startAddress|the starting location of the memory block on which the CRC calculation needs to be performed. This needs to be aligned on a 4 byte boundary.|
|length|size of the memory block in terms of 32-bit word.|
|chain|indicates if the transaction is a new transaction or calculation over non-contiguous memory block|
|crc|pointer to the return parameter where the calculated CRC result is stored. This should be inverted to match standard CRC implementations. This should be kept non-inverted if used a starting point for subsequent CRC calculations.|

## Returns

*true* - The CRC was calculated successfully.

*false* - A fault occurred while calculating the CRC.

## Example

```c
const uint8_t crc_data[16] = {0xf0, 0x7f, 0x00, 0x20, 0x19,0x0c,
0x00, 0x00, 0x39, 0x0e, 0x00, 0x00, 0x3b, 0x0e, 0x00, 0x00}

uint32_t crc = 0;

CRCCU_Initialize();

if (CRCCU_CRCCalculate((uint32_t)&crc_data, 16, &crc, false) == true)
{
    //application specific code
}
```

## Remarks

None.
