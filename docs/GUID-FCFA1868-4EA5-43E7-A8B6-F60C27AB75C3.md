## C

```c
void RTC_FrequencyCorrect (int8_t correction)
```

## Summary

Calibrate for too-slow or too-fast oscillator.

## Description

This function allows the application to calibrate the RTC frequency. The RTC<br />module will add or subtract cycles from the RTC prescaler to adjust the<br />frequency in steps of approximately 1ppm. The provided correction value<br />should be between -127 to 127. A positive correction value adds counts and<br />increase the period, thus reducing the frequency. A negative count will have<br />the reverse effect.

## Precondition

RTC\_Initialize must have been called for the associated RTC instance. The Generate Frequency Correction API option in MHC should have been selected.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|correction|Signed 8 bit correction value. If no correction is needed, set value to zero|

## Returns

None.

## Example

```c
RTC_Initialize();

// Positive correction. This reduces frequency.
RTC_FrequencyCorrect(5);

// Negatvie correction. This increase frequency.
RTC_FrequencyCorrect(-10);
```

## Remarks

None.
