**Parent topic:**[Reinforced Safety Watchdog Timer \(RSWDT\)](GUID-17C65C1B-EC26-4F1C-9599-EA23E3B7D00B.md)

## C

```c
void RSWDT_CallbackRegister( RSWDT_CALLBACK callback, uintptr_t context )
```

## Summary

Sets the pointer to the function \(and it's context\) to be called when the Timeout events occur.

## Description

This function sets the pointer to a client function to be called "back" when the Timeout event occurs. It also passes a context value that is passed into the function when it is called. This function is available only in interrupt mode of operation.

## Precondition

RSWDT\_Initialize must have been called for the associated RSWDT instance. Reset mode must be disabled in MCC configuration

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|callback|A pointer to a function with a calling signature definedby the RSWDT\_CALLBACK data type|
|context|A value \(usually a pointer\) passed \(unused\) into the functionidentified by the callback parameter|

## Returns

None.

## Example

```c
RSWDT_CallbackRegister(MyCallback, &myData);
```

## Remarks

The context value may be set to NULL if it is not required. Note that the value of NULL will still be passed to the callback function. To disable the callback function, pass a NULL for the callback parameter. See the RSWDT\_CALLBACK type definition for additional information. This feature may or may not be available based on device.
