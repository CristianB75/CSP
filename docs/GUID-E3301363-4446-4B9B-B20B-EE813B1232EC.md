# Watchdog Timer \(WDT\)

The Watchdog Timer \(WDT\) is used to prevent system lockup if the software becomes trapped in a deadlock. It features one 12-bit down<br />counter that allows a watchdog period of up to 16 seconds \(slow clock around 32 kHz\).

The WDT can generate a general reset or a processor reset only. In addition, it can be stopped while the processor is in Debug mode or Sleep mode \(Idle mode\).

**Using The Library**

The WDT is used to prevent system lockup if the software becomes trapped in a deadlock. It is supplied with VDDCORE. It restarts with initial values on processor reset.

The WDT is built around a 12-bit down counter loaded with the value defined in field PERIOD of the Window Level Register \(WDT\_WLR\). WDT uses slow clock divided by 128 to establish the maximum watchdog period to 16 seconds \(with a typical slow clock of 32.768 kHz\).

Here is an example code to enable watchdog timer and keep clearing at regular intervals

```c
WDT_Enable();

while ( true )
{
    // Application Code

    WDT_Clear();
}
```
