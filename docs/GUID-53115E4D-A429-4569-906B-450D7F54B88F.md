## C

The prototype of this function varies based on device family. Refer to the generated header file for the actual prototype to be used.

```c
void DMAC_ChannelPatternMatchSetup(DMAC_CHANNEL channel, uint8_t patternMatchData);
```

```c
void DMAC_ChannelPatternMatchSetup(DMAC_CHANNEL channel, DMAC_DATA_PATTERN_SIZE patternSize, uint16_t patternMatchData);
```

## Summary

Sets up DMA channel for pattern matching

## Description

This function sets up a DMA channel for pattern matching. while transferring<br />the data via DMA, if data chunk is matched with the given data, then DMA<br />transfer stops. This feature is useful in applications where a variable data<br />size is required and eases the set up of the DMA channel. UART is a good<br />example of where this can be effectively used.

## Parameters

Parameters of this function varies based on device family. Refer to the one which is applicable for the device being used.<br />\| Param \| Description \|<br />\|:----- \|:----------- \|<br />\| DMAC\_CHANNEL channel \| the particular channel to be setup for pattern matching \|<br />\| patternMatchData \| 8 bit data to be matched

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|DMAC\_CHANNEL channel|the particular channel to be setup for pattern matching|
|patternSize|selects pattern data size|
|patternMatchData|pattern data to be matched|

## Returns

None.

## Example

Example of this function varies based on device family. Refer to the one which is applicable for the device being used.

```c
DMAC_ChannelPatternMatchSetup (DMAC_CHANNEL_0, 0x55);
```

```c
