# MCPWM\_ChannelSecondaryTriggerSet Function

**Parent topic:**[Motor Control Pulse-Width Modulation \(MCPWM\)](GUID-89C7FC43-0090-4047-99CD-F7EE4881E28E.md)

## C

```c
void MCPWM_ChannelSecondaryTriggerSet (MCPWM_CH_NUM channel, uint16_t trigger)
```

## Summary

Writes the secondary trigger compare value to trigger ADC conversion

## Description

This function writes secondary trigger compare value to trigger ADC conversion

## Precondition

MCPWM\_Initialize\(\) function must have been called first for the associated instance and associated channel must be running.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|channel|MCPWM channel number|
|trigger|compare value which is compared with time base|

## Returns

None

## Example

```c
MCPWM_Initialize();
MCPWM_Start();
MCPWM_ChannelSecondaryTriggerSet(MCPWM_CH_0, 0x25);
```

## Remarks

When trigger compare value matches the counter, interrupt can be generated and this trigger is used to synchronize an ADC conversion with the PWM.
