## C

```c
/* x = FLEXCOM instance number */

/* Ring buffer mode */

size_t FLEXCOMx_USART_ReadBufferSizeGet(void)
```

## Summary

Returns the size of the receive ring buffer

## Description

This function returns the size of the receive ring buffer, which is same as the size of the receive ring buffer configured in MHC.

## Precondition

FLEXCOMx\_USART\_Initialize must have been called for the associated FLEXCOM\_USART instance.

## Parameters

None

## Returns

The API returns the size of the receive ring buffer. If 9-bit mode is enabled, then the return value indicates the number of 9-bit data that can be copied to the internal receive ring buffer.

## Example

```c
size_t rxBufferSize;

rxBufferSize = FLEXCOM0_USART_ReadBufferSizeGet();

```

## Remarks

None
