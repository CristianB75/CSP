# Clock Generator \(CLOCK\)

The PIC32MK GP/MC clock system has the following modules and features:

-   Five external and internal oscillator options as clock sources

-   On-Chip PLL with user-selectable input divider, multiplier and output<br />divider to boost operating frequency on select internal and external<br />oscillator sources

-   On-Chip user-selectable divisor postscaler on select oscillator<br />sources

-   Software-controllable switching between various clock sources

-   A Fail-Safe Clock Monitor \(FSCM\) that detects clock failure and<br />permits safe application recovery or shut down with dedicated FRC

-   Dedicated On-Chip PLL for USB modules

-   Flexible reference clock output

-   Multiple clock branches for peripherals for better performance<br />flexibility
