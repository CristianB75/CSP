# SEFCx\_CallbackRegister Function

**Parent topic:**[Secure Embedded Flash Controller \(SEFC\)](GUID-E586E73A-F607-48C1-A0B8-EC4E231FB77A.md)

## C

```c
void SEFCx_CallbackRegister( SEFCx_CALLBACK callback, uintptr_t context ) // x - Instance of the SEFC peripheral
```

## Summary

Sets the pointer to the function \(and it's context\) to be called when the operation is complete.

## Description

This function sets the pointer to a client function to be called "back" when the SEFCx is ready to receive new command. It also passes a context value that is passed into the function when it is called. This function is available only in interrupt mode of operation.

## Precondition

None.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|callback|A pointer to a function with a calling signature definedby the SEFCx\_CALLBACK data type.|
|context|A value \(usually a pointer\) passed \(unused\) into the functionidentified by the callback parameter.|

## Returns

None.

## Example

```c
SEFC0_CallbackRegister(MyCallback, &myData);
```

## Remarks

The context value may be set to NULL if it is not required. Note that the value of NULL will still be passed to the callback function.

To disable the callback function, pass a NULL for the callback parameter. See the SEFCx\_CALLBACK type definition for additional information.
