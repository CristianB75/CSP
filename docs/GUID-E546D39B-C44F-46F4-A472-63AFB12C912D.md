## C

```c
void RTC_Timer16CallbackRegister ( RTC_TIMER16_CALLBACK callback,
uintptr_t context )
```

## Summary

Register the callback function to be called when an 16-bit Timer Interrupt occurs.

## Description

This function registers the callback function that the library will call<br />when an interrupt occurs. The library will return the event that has caused<br />the interrupt and the application specified context in the callback<br />function.

## Precondition

The RTC\_Initialize\(\) function should have been called to initialize the RTC module. The module should have been configured for 16-bit Timer Counter operation in MHC. The library should have been configured for Interrupt mode operation.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|callback|A pointer to a function with a calling signature defined by the RTC\_TIMER16\_CALLBACK data type. Passing a NULL value disables the callback|
|context|A value \(usually a pointer\) that passed into the callback function when the callback function is called|

## Returns

None.

## Example

```c
// Refer to the description of the RTC_TIMER16_CALLBACK data type for
// example usage of this function.
```

## Remarks

To disable the callback function, pass a NULL for the callback parameter. See the RTC\_TIMER16\_CALLBACK type definition for additional information.
