**Parent topic:**[Debug Unit \(DBGU\)](GUID-97C41240-2AC0-4D05-A97E-83EB780C57A2.md)

## C

```c
/* x = DBGU instance number */

/* Non-blocking mode */

bool DBGU_WriteIsBusy( void )
```

## Summary

Returns the write request status associated with the given DBGU peripheral instance

## Description

This function returns the write request status associated with the given DBGU peripheral instance. It can be used to check the completion status of the DBGU\_Write\(\) function when the library is configured for non-blocking \(interrupt\) mode. In that, the function can be used as an alternative to using a callback function to check for completion.

## Precondition

DBGU\_Initialize must have been called for the associated DBGU instance.

## Parameters

None.

## Returns

*true* - DBGU is busy in processing the previous write request.

*false* - DBGU is free and ready to accept a new write request.

## Example

```c
if(DBGU_WriteIsBusy() == true)
{
    //DBGU is currently processing the previous write request.
    //Wait to submit new request.
}

```

## Remarks

None
