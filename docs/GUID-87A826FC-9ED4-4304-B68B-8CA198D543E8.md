## C

```c

/* Ring buffer mode */

typedef enum
{
    /* Threshold number of bytes are available in the receive ring buffer */
    SERCOM_USART_EVENT_READ_THRESHOLD_REACHED = 0,

    /* Receive ring buffer is full. Application must read the data out to avoid missing data on the next RX interrupt. */
    SERCOM_USART_EVENT_READ_BUFFER_FULL,

    /* USART error. Application must call the SERCOMx_USART_ErrorGet API to get the type of error and clear the error. */
    SERCOM_USART_EVENT_READ_ERROR,

    /* Threshold number of free space is available in the transmit ring buffer */
    SERCOM_USART_EVENT_WRITE_THRESHOLD_REACHED,

    /* Recevie break signal is detected */
    SERCOM_USART_EVENT_BREAK_SIGNAL_DETECTED,
}SERCOM_USART_EVENT;

```

## Summary

Defines the enums associated with the USART events in the ring buffer mode

## Description

Defines the enums associated with the USART events in the ring buffer mode. An event of this type is passed in the read and write callbacks to let application identify the UART event type.

## Remarks

None
