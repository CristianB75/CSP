# Clock Generator \(CLOCK\)

The PIC32MZ W1 clock system has the following modules and features:

-   A total of five external and internal oscillator options as clock<br />sources

-   Four on-chip PLLs with user-selectable input divider,<br />multiplier and output divider to boost operating frequency on select<br />\\internal and external oscillator sources

-   On-Chip user-selectable divisor postscaler on select<br />oscillator sources

-   Software-controllable switching between various clock sources

-   Dedicated on-chip PLL for USB peripheral \(internal\), Ethernet phy<br />and external Bluetooth module

-   Flexible reference clock output

-   Multiple clock branches for peripherals for better performance<br />flexibility

-   Clock switch/slew control with output divider
