# DIVAS\_DivmodUnsigned Function

**Parent topic:**[Divide and Square Root Accelerator \(DIVAS\)](GUID-B166C830-24C9-4294-B2AB-EB296A821887.md)

## C

```c
uint64_t DIVAS_DivmodUnsigned( uint32_t numerator, uint32_t denominator)
```

## Summary

This function uses the DIVAS peripheral to performs a unsigned 32-bit division, and returns both the quotient and remainder as 64-bit number.

## Description

This function uses the DIVAS peripheral to perform a unsigned 32-bit division.<br />The function takes a unsigned divisor and dividend as input, and returns quotient and remainder as 64-bit number

## Precondition

The peripheral should have been initialized by calling the DIVAS\_Initialize\(\) function once.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|numerator|This should contain the unsigned dividend.|
|denominator|This should contain the unsigned divisor|

## Returns

Returns quotient and remainder as 64-bit number \(32-bit LSB is quotient and 32-bit MSB is remainder\)

## Example

```c
uint32_t dividend;
uint32_t divisor;
uint64_t divmod;

dividend = 10000;
divisor = 2000;

divmod = DIVAS_DivmodUnsigned(dividend, divisor)

```

## Remarks

None.
