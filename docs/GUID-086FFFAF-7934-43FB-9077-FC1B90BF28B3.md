## C

```c
uint32_t RTC_Timer32FrequencyGet ( void )
```

## Summary

Returns the frequency at which the 32-bit timer counter is operating.

## Description

This function returns the frequency at which the 32-bit timer counter is operating. The return value can be used to compute the period that needs to be set in order to operate the timer counter at a desired frequency.

## Precondition

None.

## Parameters

None.

## Returns

Returns the frequency at which the 32-bit timer counter is operating.

## Example

```c
// Compute the period required to operate the timer at 1KHz.

uint32_t desiredFrequency = 1000;
uint32_t period = RTC_Timer32FrequencyGet()/desiredFrequency;
RTC_Initialize();
RTC_Timer32CompareSet(period);

```

## Remarks

None.
