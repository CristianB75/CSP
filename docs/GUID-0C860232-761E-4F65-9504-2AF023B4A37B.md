# USARTx\_ReadBufferSizeGet Function

**Parent topic:**[Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver Transceiver \(USART\)](GUID-5ED4F08A-8227-486D-9727-78BD47CA0866.md)

## C

```c
/* x = USART instance number */

/* Ring buffer mode */
size_t USARTx_ReadBufferSizeGet(void)
```

## Summary

Returns the size of the receive ring buffer

## Description

This function returns the size of the receive ring buffer, which is same as the size of the receive ring buffer configured in MHC.

## Precondition

USARTx\_Initialize must have been called for the associated USART instance.

## Parameters

None

## Returns

The API returns the size of the receive ring buffer. If 9-bit mode is enabled, then the return value indicates the number of 9-bit data that can be copied to the internal receive ring buffer.

## Example

```c
size_t rxBufferSize;

rxBufferSize = USART1_ReadBufferSizeGet();

```

## Remarks

None
