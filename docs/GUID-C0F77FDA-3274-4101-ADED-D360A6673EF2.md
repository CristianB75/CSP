# Flash Read Controller \(FCR\) \(FCR\)

FCR peripheral provides following features, however the PLIB supports only limited ones.

-   SFR interface to control Flash Read features \(wait states, ECC reporting, arbitration\), and Functional Safety features \(ECC Fault and Flash CRC\)

-   SEC/DED Hamming Code based ECC capability for improved flash reliability

-   Optional ECC Fault \(FLT\)

-   Optional CRC for Invariable Memory Test

-   HSM \(Hardware Security Module\) Support


**Using The Library**

FCR PLIB provides simple interface to read flash content of the device.

Here is an example code to read from Flash memory

```c
uint8_t buffer[256];

FCR_Read( (uint32_t *) buffer, 256, 0xC008000U);
```
