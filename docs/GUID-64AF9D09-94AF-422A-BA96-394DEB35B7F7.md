// The Reference Year Configuration in MHC should be within
// 64 years of 1980. Also note that tm structure needs the tm_year to
// specified as years since 1900.

initialTime.tm_sec = 23;
initialTime.tm_min = 31;
initialTime.tm_hour = 22;
initialTime.tm_mday = 7;
initialTime.tm_mon = 3;
initialTime.tm_year = 80;

RTC_RTCCTimeSet(&initialTime);

// Get the current time.
