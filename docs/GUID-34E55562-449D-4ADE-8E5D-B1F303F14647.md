# RTC\_Timer16Compare2HasMatched Function

**Parent topic:**[Real-Time Counter \(RTC\)](GUID-3578D06D-FEC5-4769-ADC7-0D46730CD973.md)

## C

```c
bool RTC_Timer16Compare2HasMatched(void)
```

## Summary

Returns true if the 16-bit Timer Compare 2 value has matched the counter.

## Description

This function returns true if the 16-bit Timer Compare 2 value has matched the counter. When operating in 16-bit Timer Counter mode, the RTC peripheral compares the counter value with compare values \(Compare 2\). This function will return true if the counter value has matched the Compare 2 value. The Compare 2 Value could have been configured via MHC or at run time by calling the RTC\_Timer16Compare2Set\(\) function. The RTC\_Timer16Compare2ValueMatched\(\) function allows the application to poll for the compare value match.

## Precondition

RTC\_Initialize, RTC\_Timer16Start must have been called for the associated RTC instance. The RTC value should have been configured for 16-bit Timer Counter Mode.

## Parameters

None.

## Returns

True, if Counter has matched Compare 2 Value and False otherwise.

## Example

```c
RTC_Initialize();
RTC_Timer16CounterSet(0);
RTC_Timer16PeriodSet(0xFFF);

// Calling the RTC_Timer16Compare2Set() function will override the
RTC_Timer16Compare2Set(0x3F);
RTC_Timer16Start();

// Wait till the Compare 2 value has matched.
while(!RTC_Timer16Compare2HasMatched());
```

## Remarks

This API is available for devices that have more than two compare register in 16-bit mode.
