# PORT\_PinLatchRead Function

**Parent topic:**[I/O Pin Controller \(PORT\)](GUID-7F443A35-9F1B-49DE-B591-83F974FA576B.md)

## C

```c
bool PORT_PinLatchRead(PORT_PIN pin)
```

## Summary

Read the value driven on the selected pin.

## Description

This function reads the data driven on the selected I/O line/pin. The<br />function does not sample the state of the hardware pin. It only returns the<br />value that is written to output register. Refer to the PORT\_PinRead\(\)<br />function if the state of the output pin needs to be read.

## Precondition

The PORT\_Initialize\(\) function should have been called.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|pin|One of the IO pins from the enum PORT\_PIN.|

## Returns

*- true* - the present value in the output latch is a logic high.

*- false* - the present value in the output latch is a logic low.

## Example

```c
bool value;
value = PORT_PinLatchRead(PORT_PIN_PB03);

```

## Remarks

To read actual pin value, PIN\_Read API should be used.
