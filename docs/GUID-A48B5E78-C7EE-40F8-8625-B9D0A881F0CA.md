# TWIx\_Write Function

**Parent topic:**[Two-wire Interface - TWI](GUID-384E478E-B880-4F6B-83D6-792074118820.md)

## C

```c
/* x = TWI instance number */

/* TWI master mode */
bool TWIx_Write(uint16_t address, uint8_t *pdata, size_t length)
```

## Summary

Writes data to the TWI slave

## Description

This function writes data to a TWI slave on the bus. The function will attempt to write length number of bytes from pdata buffer to a slave whose address is specified by address. The TWI Master will generate a Start condition, write the data and then generate a Stop Condition. If the slave NAKs the request or a bus error was encountered on the bus, the transfer is terminated. The application can call the TWIx\_ErrorGet function to know the cause of the error. The function is non-blocking. It initiates bus activity and returns immediately. The transfer is then completed in the peripheral interrupt. A transfer request cannot be placed when another transfer is in progress. Calling the write function when another function is already in progress will cause the function to return false. If a callback was registered, the library will call the registered callback function when the transfer has completed.

## Precondition

TWIx\_Initialize must have been called for the associated TWI instance.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|address|7-bit / 10-bit slave address.|
|pdata|pointer to source data buffer|
|length|length of data buffer in number of bytes.|

## Returns

*true* - The request was placed successfully and the bus activity was initiated.

*false* - The request fails, if there was already a transfer in progress when this function was called.

## Example

```c
uint8_t myData [NUM_BYTES];

if(!TWI1_Write( SLAVE_ADDR, &myData[0], NUM_BYTES ))
{
    // error handling
}
```

## Remarks

None.
