**Parent topic:**[Debug Unit \(DBGU\)](GUID-97C41240-2AC0-4D05-A97E-83EB780C57A2.md)

## C

```c

/* Non-blocking mode */

bool DBGU_ReadIsBusy( void )
```

## Summary

Returns the read request status associated with the given DBGU peripheral instance

## Description

This function returns the read request status associated with the given DBGU peripheral instance. It can be used to check the completion status of the DBGU\_Read\(\) function when the library is configured for interrupt \(non-blocking\) mode. In that, the function can be used as an alternative to using a callback function to check for completion.

## Precondition

DBGU\_Initialize must have been called for the associated DBGU instance.

## Parameters

None.

## Returns

*true* - DBGU is busy in processing the previous read request

*false* - DBGU is free and ready to accept the new read request

## Example

```c
if(DBGU_ReadIsBusy() == true)
{
    //DBGU is currently processing the previous read request.
    //Wait to submit new request.
}

```

## Remarks

None
