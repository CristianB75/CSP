# MCPWM\_ChannelPrimaryTriggerSet Function

**Parent topic:**[Motor Control Pulse-Width Modulation \(MCPWM\)](GUID-89C7FC43-0090-4047-99CD-F7EE4881E28E.md)

## C

```c
void MCPWM_ChannelPrimaryTriggerSet (MCPWM_CH_NUM channel, uint16_t trigger)
```

## Summary

Writes the primary trigger compare value to trigger ADC conversion

## Description

This function writes primary trigger compare value to trigger ADC conversion

## Precondition

MCPWM\_Initialize\(\) function must have been called first for the associated instance. And associated channel must be running.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|channel|MCPWM channel number|
|trigger|compare value which is compared with time base|

## Returns

None

## Example

```c
MCPWM_Initialize();
MCPWM_Start();
MCPWM_ChannelPrimaryTriggerSet(MCPWM_CH_0, 0x25);
```

## Remarks

When trigger compare value matches the counter of primary time base, interrupt can be generated. And this trigger is used to synchronize an ADC conversion with the primary time base.
