# Clock Generator \(CLOCK\)

The PIC32CX\_BZ clock system has the following modules and features:

-   A total of five external and internal oscillator options as clock<br />sources

-   Provides control registers for all PLLs

-   Provides for glitch-free clock switching between various clock<br />sources

-   Post dividers on processor clock generator to slow down system clock<br />for power save

-   A fail safe clock monitor that detects clock failure and provides<br />automatic switching to the FRC

-   Provides control registers for user interface of clocks and resets

-   Provides configuration bits for oscillator selection and calibration<br />of on-chip oscillators

-   Provides control registers to generate a reference clock output

-   Multiple PB clock dividers

-   One System Clock, cru\_sys\_clk, from which almost all clocks used<br />throughout the system are derived

-   Three Peripheral Clocks, created by independent integer dividers of<br />the sys\_clk

-   Six Reference Output Clocks \(REFO1 - REFO6\) with the following clock<br />sources

-   JTAG TCK clock control


**Using The Library**
