**Parent topic:**[Flash Write Control \(FCW\)](GUID-90E21DD6-5AB3-4211-8633-884EC95A6246.md)

## C

```c
bool FCW_PageErase( uint32_t address )
```

## Summary

Erases a Page in the FCW

## Description

This function will erase one page in FCW. Calling this function will cause the CPU execution to stall, hence blocking execution of any other thread. Execution resumes when the Erase operation has completed.

If the interrupt operation was enabled and if a callback was registered, then the callback function will be called. The FCW\_IsBusy\(\) function can be used to poll for completion of the operation.

The application should ensure that there are no other operations in progress before calling this function.

Once the operation is complete, the FCW\_ErrorGet\(\) function can be called to check operation success.

## Precondition

Also validate if FCW controller is ready to accept new request by calling FCW\_IsBusy\(\).

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|address|start address of the page to be erased.|

## Returns

Always return true.

// This code snippet shows how the FCW_PageErase function is called to
// erase the page at locatioin 0xC088608U.

// Erase the page
FCW_PageErase(0xC088608U);

while(FCW_IsBusy());

if(FCW_ErrorGet() == FCW_ERROR_NONE)
{
    // Operation was successful.
}
