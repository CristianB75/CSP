# Clock Generator \(CLOCK\)

The Clock Generator is made up of:

-   Oscillators

    -   A low-power 32.768 kHz oscillator supporting crystals, MEMs, resonators and Bypass mode

    -   An embedded always-on, slow RC oscillator generating a typical 32 kHz clock

    -   A 12 to 48 MHz oscillator supporting crystals, MEMs, resonators and Bypass mode

    -   A Main RC oscillator generating a typical 12 MHz clock

-   Three fractional-N PLLs


It provides the following clocks:

-   MD SCLK - Monitoring Domain Slow clock, This clock sourced from the always-on Slow RC oscillator only, is the only permanent clock of the system and feeds safety-critical functions of the device.

-   TD SCLK - Timing Domain Slow clock. This clock, sourced from the 32. 768 kHz crystal oscillator or the always-on Slow RC oscillator, is routed to the RTC and RTT peripherals.

-   MAINCK - Output of the Main clock oscillator selection. This clock is either the Main crystal oscillator or Main RC oscillator.

-   PLL Clocks - Outputs of embedded PLLs

-   One SysTick external clock for each processor core


**Using The Library**
