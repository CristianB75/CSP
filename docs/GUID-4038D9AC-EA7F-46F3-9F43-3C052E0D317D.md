## C

```c
/* x = UART instance number */

/* Non-blocking and ring buffer mode */

size_t UARTx_ReadCountGet( void )
```

## Summary

*Non-blocking mode*

Gets the byte count of processed bytes for a given UART read operation

*Ring buffer mode*

Returns the number of bytes available in the internal receive buffer of the PLIB

## Description

*Non-blocking mode*

This function gets the count of processed bytes for an on-going or last completed UART Read operation. This function can be used to track the progress of the non-blocking read operation. In case of an error, this function can be used to track the number of bytes that were received before the error occurred.

*Ring buffer mode*

This function returns the number of bytes available in the receive buffer

## Precondition

UARTx\_Initialize must have been called for the associated UART instance.

## Parameters

None.

## Returns

*Non-blocking mode*

Returns count of bytes completed/processed to the current Receive buffer. In 9-bit mode, it returns the number of 9-bit data processed.

*Ring buffer mode*

The API returns the number of bytes pending to be read out from the receive buffer. If 9-bit mode is enabled, then the API returns the number of 9-bit data pending to be read out from the receive buffer.

## Example

*Non-blocking mode*

```c
size_t count;

count = UART1_ReadCountGet();

if(count < COUNT_EXPECTED)
{
    //More bytes are expected, wait
}

```

*Ring buffer mode*

```c
uint8_t rxBuffer[100];
uint32_t nBytesAvailable;

nBytesAvailable = UART1_ReadCountGet();

if (nBytesAvailable != 0)
{
    UART1_Read((uint8_t*)rxBuffer, nBytesAvailable)
}
```

## Remarks

None
