## C

```c
void RTC_Timer32CompareSet ( uint32_t compare )
```

## Summary

Set the 32-bit timer period value.

## Description

This function sets the 32-bit timer compare value. The counter value will be compared against the compare value and a compare match event will occur when the counter matches the compare value. If the library is configured for interrupt mode and if a event handler function has been set through the RTC\_Timer32CallbackRegister\(\) function, the event handling function will be called. When the match occurs, the counter can optionally be reset if clear on compare is enabled to generate periodic interrupt.

## Precondition

RTC\_Initialize must have been called for the associated RTC instance. The RTC peripheral should have been configured in 32-bit Timer Counter mode.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|compare|Compare value|

## Returns

None.

## Example

```c
uint32_t period = 0x00000FFF;
RTC_Initialize();
RTC_Timer32CompareSet(period);
RTC_Timer32CounterSet(0);
RTC_Timer32Start();
while(!RTC_Timer32CompareHasMatched());
```

## Remarks

This API is available for devices that have only one compare register in 32-bit mode.<br />The RTC\_Timer32Start\(\) should typically be called after the period has been set.
