# CCPx\_TimerFrequencyGet Function

**Parent topic:**[Capture/Compare/PWM \(CCP\)](GUID-615BEA57-7216-4351-87D8-94C8B0BF6E7D.md)

## C

```c
/* x = CCP instance number */

uint32_t CCPx_TimerFrequencyGet( void );
```

## Summary

Provides the given timer's counter-increment frequency.

## Description

This function provides the frequency at which the given counter<br />increments. It can be used to convert differences between counter values<br />to real time or real-time intervals to timer period values.

## Precondition

CCPx\_TimerInitialize\(\) function must have been called first.

## Parameters

None.

## Returns

*frequency* - The frequency \(in Hz\) at which the timer's counter increments.

## Example

```c
uint32_t frequency = 0;
CCP1_TimerInitialize();
frequency = CCP1_TimerFrequencyGet();
```

## Remarks

None.
