## C

```c
typedef void (*WDT_CALLBACK)(uintptr_t context);

typedef void (*WDT_CALLBACK)(uintptr_t context, uint32_t interruptStatus);
```

## Summary

Defines the data type and function signature for the WDT peripheral callback function.

## Description

This data type defines the function signature for the WDT peripheral callback function. The WDT peripheral will call back the client's function with this signature in different ways based on device family<br />- When the Timeout event has occurred

```
- When A Early Warning Event has occurred. This interrupt indicates to the application that an WDT timeout is about to occur.
```

This feature may or may not be available based on device.

## Precondition

WDT\_Initialize must have been called for the given WDT peripheral instance and WDT\_CallbackRegister must have been called to set the function to be called.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|context|Allows the caller to provide a context value \(usually a pointer to the callers context for multi-instance clients\).|
|interruptStatus|WDT interrupt status|

## Returns

None.
