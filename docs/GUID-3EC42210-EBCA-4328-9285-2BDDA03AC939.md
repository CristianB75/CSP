## C

```c

/* Blocking, non-blocking and ring buffer mode */

typedef struct
{
    uint32_t baudRate;
    
    UART_PARITY parity;
    
    UART_DATA dataWidth;
    
    UART_STOP stopBits;
    
} UART_SERIAL_SETUP;

```

## Summary

Defines the data type for the UART serial setup.

## Description

This can be used to define a serial setup which may then be used to change the serial setup of the UART dynamically by passing an instance of this struct as an argument to the UARTx\_SerialSetup API.

## Remarks

Some of the struct members may not be available based on the device family. Refer the generated header file for the complete list of struct members available on that device.
